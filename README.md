## Learning Reflections

## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview

In this project, I recreated a basic Instagram profile page by using CSS for layout and styling. I focused on making the design look good and work well on different devices. I applied various techniques like media queries for responsiveness and animations for user interactivity, Flexbox for alignment, and CSS Grid for layout.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Animations**: I feel confident with adding and using CSS animations in the web page.
-**Hover and Focus Effects**:Creating interactive elements such as hover and focus effects was not that difficult.
- **Responsive Design**: I effectively applied media queries to ensure a visually appealing layout on both desktop and mobile screens.

#### Challenges Faced

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: Organizing the pictures into a grid posed a challenge for me. Grid demanded additional practice and research to ensure its proper implementation.
- **Styling Elements**: I faced challenges in styling the profile image, user information, and gallery section, making it difficult to closely resemble an Instagram profile.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Code Optimization**: Since my code did not produce the desired outcome, I would like to work on it practice more and write better code.
-**Layout with CSS**: I want to go back to the notes on CSS layout especially the ones that target grid, study the notes and practice to become better.

#### Overall Learning Experience

This project provided me with valuable hands-on experience in applying CSS layout techniques and CSS Animations. It gave me the platform to apply what I've been reading,  and it reinforced my understanding of CSS and its practical applications in web development. I am eager to further develop these skills in future projects and to apply what I have learned while doing this project into other projects.
